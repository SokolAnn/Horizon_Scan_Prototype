5,"Evidence the taxa is able to spread via long-distance dispersal mechanisms via natural (e.g., dispersal along interconnected waterways/basins/seas, animal dispersal) and anthropogenic secondary pathways (e.g., popularity in trade, or known hitchhikers on or in commodities and vehicles) AND high reproductive rate. Species spread from source population rapidly.",Arrival (pathway),Establishment
4,"Evidence the taxa infrequently and/or inefficiently spreads via natural (e.g., dispersal along interconnected waterways/basins/seas, animal dispersal) and anthropogenic secondary pathways (e.g., popularity in trade, or known hitchhikers on or in commodities and vehicles) AND moderate reproductive rates. Species spread from source population rapidly.",,
3,"Evidence the taxa is able to spread via moderate-distance dispersal mechanisms (e.g., fruits attractive to birds or mammals, adaptations for wind or water dispersal, human mediated dispersal mechanisms, movement through tunnels or land bridges) AND moderate reproductive rate. The species has spread from its orignal source poplation at a moderate pace.",,
2,"Evidence the taxa infrequently and/or inefficiently spreads via moderate-distance dispersal mechanisms (e.g., fruits attractive to birds or mammals, adaptations for wind or water dispersal, human mediated dispersal mechanisms, movement through tunnels or land bridges) AND low reproductive rate. The species has not spread from its orignal source poplation rapidly.",,
1,No evidence the taxa is able to spread via long or moderate-distance dispersal mechanisms AND low reproductive rate. The species has not spread from its orignal source poplation rapidly.,,

5,A taxon is likely to cause (a) the replacement and local extinction of native species and will produce irreversible changes in the structure of communities and the abiotic or biotic composition of ecosystems or (b) local disappearance of a social or economic activity from all or part of the area invaded by the alien taxon or major effects to human health-,Impact,
4,"A taxon is likely to cause (a) the local or population extinction of at least one native species, leading to reversible changes  in the structure of communities, the abiotic or biotic composition of ecosystems (b) the local  disappearance of a social or economic activity from all or part of the area invaded by the alien taxon, collapse of the specific activity, switch to other activities, abandonment of activity without replacement, emigration from region, or moderate effects to human health. The taxon has no impacts that would cause it to be classified in a higher impact category",,
3,"A taxon is likely to cause (a) declines in the population size(s) of native species, but no changes to the structure of communities or to the abiotic or biotic composition of ecosystems or (b) changes in the size of social activities, with fewer people participating, but the activity is still carried out. These changes to social activities could be linked to accessibility to the activity area or mild effects to human health (e.g., allergies). The taxon has no impacts that would cause it to be classified in a higher impact category",,
2,"A taxon is likely to cause (a) declines in the performance (e.g., biomass, body size) of native biota, but no decline in native population sizes or (b) income loss, minor health problems, higher effort, or expense to participate in activities, increased difficulty in accessing goods, or minor disruption of social activities, but no significant impact on participation in normal activities. The taxon has no other impacts that would cause it to be classified in a higher impact category",,
1,"A taxon is unlikely to cause negative impacts on the native biota or abiotic environment, human well?being, or economic systems",,

5,"No known management techniques AND/OR the detectability of the species is very low, making effective surveillance difficult if not impossible",Ease of eraditcation,
4,"Management techniques available, but not effective, difficult to control without damaging natives, requires retreatment at least once per year over next 5 years, AND/OR the species has low detectability, necessitating more extensive and perhaps less effective surveillance measures",,
3,"Management techniques available, difficult to control without damaging natives, retreatment necessary one to four times over next 5 years, AND/OR the species is moderately detectable, which may necessitate targeted surveillance efforts",,
2,"Effective management techniques available, minimal damage to natives, requires one retreatment, AND/OR The species is highly detectable, making surveillance efforts more effective",,
1,"Effective management techniques available, the taxa can typically be controlled without damage to native species, no retreatment necessary AND/OR the species has very high detectability, allowing for efficient and targeted management",,
